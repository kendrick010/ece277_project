  CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of

    Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
    to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
    to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
